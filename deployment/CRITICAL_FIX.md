# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX: Update index.html

## The Problem:
The server at vlzen.com is serving an old `index.html` that references a non-existent JavaScript file.

**Current (Broken):**
```html
<script src="/assets/index-rajwW3gj.js"></script>  <!-- ❌ File doesn't exist -->
```

**Needed (Fixed):**
```html
<script src="/assets/index-DWhPCfRs.js"></script>  <!-- ✅ File exists -->
```

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE FIX:

### Step 1: Upload the Correct index.html
Upload this file to your server:
- **File:** `deployment/index.html`
- **Destination:** Replace the existing `index.html` on vlzen.com

### Step 2: Verify the Fix

```bash
curl https://vlzen.com
