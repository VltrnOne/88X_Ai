# 📁 File Move Instructions for SiteGround

## 🎯 The Problem:
Files are in the wrong location:
- **Current:** `vlzen.com/deployment/` (correct files)
- **Needed:** `vlzen.com/` (root directory)

## 🚀 Solution: Move Files to Root

### Step 1: Access File Manager
1. Log into SiteGround Control Panel
2. Go to "File Manager"
3. Navigate to `public_html/deployment/`

### Step 2: Select All Files
Select these files/folders:
- ✅ `index.html`
- ✅ `assets/` (entire folder)
- ✅ `vite.svg`
- ✅ Any other files in deployment folder

### Step 3: Move to Root
1. Click "Move" button in toolbar
2. Set destination: `/public_html/`
3. Click "Move Files"
4. Confirm the action

### Step 4: Clean Up
1. Navigate back to `public_html/`
2. Verify files are now in root directory
3. Delete the empty `deployment/` folder

## ✅ Verification:
After moving files, these URLs should work:
- ✅ `https://vlzen.com/` (main site)
- ✅ `https://vlzen.com/assets/index-DWhPCfRs.js` (JavaScript)
- ✅ `https://vlzen.com/assets/index-Cyyab_dj.css` (CSS)

## 🎯 Expected Result:
The VLTRN interface should load immediately after the move!
